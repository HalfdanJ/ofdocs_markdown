The ofMessage is an event that contains a string message that will be sent when you're send an event. The ofSendMessage() method allows you send both an event to any listeners and a message along with it. Usually custom events will get more data, a vector or a buffer of information or pictures of you looking handsome (just an example) but in case you just need to send a string along with your event, the ofMessage is there for you.
