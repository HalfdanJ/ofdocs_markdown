Maps this vector from its default coordinate system -- origin (0,0), X direction (1,0), Y direction (0,1) -- to a new coordinate system defined with origin at origin, X direction vx, and Y direction vy. 

*In most case you want vx and vy to be perpendicular and of unit length; if they are not perpendicular you will have shearing as part of the mapping, and if they are not of unit length you will have scaling as part of the mapping.*
