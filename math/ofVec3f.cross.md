Set this vector to the cross product (vector product) of itself and 'vec'. This is a binary operation on two vectors in three-dimensional space, which results in a vector that is perpendicular to both of the vectors being multiplied, and normal to the plane containing them. The name *cross product* is derived from the cross symbol X that is often used to designate this operation; the alternative name *vector product* emphasizes the vector (rather than scalar) nature of the result.
