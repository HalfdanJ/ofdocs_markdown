Default window manager based on glut. This class provides all the functionality to create a window, change/query it's size, position... and all the keyboard and mouse events.

Introduced in 006 along with ofAppBaseWindow to provide a mean of substituting the underlying windowing toolkit in oF.

The functionality provided by this class or any other inheriting from ofAppBaseWindow should not be accessed directly but through the functions available in ofAppRunner.
