The openFrameworks engine is contained in the "app" category. The project works, similar to processing, in that you have a base class which extends a class that already exists. In the case of OF, there is a class called "ofBaseApp" which contains various event driven functions. When you create an OF project, you use a main.cpp which is the boot-strap, that kicks off the application and another class, which inherits the properties of ofSimpleApp. Essentially, when you write code in the ofApp, you are re-writing already defined functions that exist in OF, such as update, draw, etc.
