This sets the index data for the VBO from a pointer to an array of ints. Each int represents the index of a vertex, and when the vbo is drawn the indices are used to generate the geometry from the indices.

The possible options for usage are: GL_STREAM_DRAW, GL_STREAM_READ, GL_STREAM_COPY, GL_STATIC_DRAW, GL_STATIC_READ, GL_STATIC_COPY, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW, GL_DYNAMIC_READ, or GL_DYNAMIC_COPY
