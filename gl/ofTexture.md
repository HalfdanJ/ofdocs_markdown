ofTexture is used to create textures that live on your graphics card from bitmap data that can then be used to fill other drawn objects, like a bitmap fill on a rectangle. When you draw an ofImage, you're actually just drawing a rectangle of points and then using an ofTexture to fill the space between those points. At it's core, ofTexture is a wrapper for OpenGL textures. It allows use of non-power of 2 textures in opengl, and to upload and draw graphical data.
