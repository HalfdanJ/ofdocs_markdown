This returns the GLuint for the actual shader object that is active on the graphics card. This is more of an advanced usage method, but can be helpful if you need to do something that the ofShader doesn't support currently. This returns only one of the shaders. You can pass GL_VERTEX_SHADER, GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER_EXT, GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER
