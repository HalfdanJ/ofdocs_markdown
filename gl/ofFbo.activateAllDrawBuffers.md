This method allows you to render the results of a shading pass to all the textures inside the FBO. It's  handy if you have many textures inside your FBO, for instance, a normals texture, a colored depth texture, a color texture, and you want to have a shader render to all of them at once. It calls glDrawBuffers() internally, which you can learn more about [here](http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glDrawBuffers.xml).
