Orthographic, or parallel, projections consist of those that involve no perspective correction. There is no adjustment for distance from the camera made in these projections, meaning objects on the screen will appear the same size no matter how close or far away they are. Calling enableOrtho() sets the ofCamera to orthographic mode.
